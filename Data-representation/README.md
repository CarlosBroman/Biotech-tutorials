# Data representation using Python (panel, holoviews)

This code can be used to create an interactive plot using Python and some libraries including pandas, numpy, panel and holoviews.

## Usage

In this code we:
 - Use the data retrieved from the webscrapping script (https://github.com/CarlosBroman/Biotech-tutorials/tree/master/webscrapping).
 - Define some functions to create the plot.
 - Read the data from the data frame and turn it into an interactive data frame.
 - Create the selection buttons.
 - Create the plot and show it in the local host.


## Output

The output will be an interactive plot in the local host. It can also be saved into an html file that retains the interactivity.
