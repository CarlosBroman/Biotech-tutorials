# Webscrapping to obtain biological data

This code can be used to obtain data from a webpage using Python.

## Usage

Please remember that webscraping might be subject to ethical constraints.

In this code:
 - Selenium allows us to install a webdriver that will be used to navigate through the desired webpage.
 - Pandas is used to create the dataframe to store the data and then convert it into a csv file.

This code can be adapted to retrieve information from any webpage. It is important to have some basic HTML knowledge to use the Selenium library.


## Output

The output will be a csv file with the desired name containing the information retrieved from the webpage.
