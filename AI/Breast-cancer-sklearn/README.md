# Prediction tumor nature based on its characteristics (sklearn)

This code creates a model to classify tumours (bening / malign) based on their characteristics.

## Usage


In this code we:
 - Load some data downloaded from UCI and preprocess it.
 - Split the data and train the models.
 - Use different classifiers to find the accuracy of the model and save them using pickle.
 - Test the model using different parameters to see if it classifies the tumours correctly.


## Output

The output will be the model that can classify these tumours.
